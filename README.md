# Voice Assistant Written in Python

Integrating Voice Assistant with Trello App:-
  The integration of voice assistant written in Python and the Trello app is possible through the use of the Trello API. The Trello API provides developers with access to the Trello application programming interface (API). This allows developers to create applications that can interact with Trello, allowing them to add, edit and delete cards, lists, and boards, as well as view and manage cards and lists. By utilizing the Trello API, a Python-based voice assistant can be programmed to interact with the Trello app. The voice assistant can be programmed to recognize voice commands and use them to perform various tasks on the Trello app, such as creating new cards and lists, assigning tasks to users, and updating existing cards and lists. Additionally, the voice assistant can be programmed to provide users with spoken feedback on the status of their tasks and their progress.
